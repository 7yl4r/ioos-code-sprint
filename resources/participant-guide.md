# Welcome to the IOOS Code Sprint

**We're glad you're here!**

This guide explains how the code sprint is being organized, from how we will be
communicating, what activities we envisage you will undertake, how we suggest
you access data and store your code/outputs.
</div>

## Overview

In this guide we'll cover:

## How our event is structured

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
We recommend that when you first sit down with your group, someone volunteers to serve as the **chair** for your topic.
This person should be responsible for:
* Ensuring that the group works to the suggested agenda.
* The group is ready to present their work during their presentation slot(s). 
* The code/outputs are well organized.
This is an excellent way of getting some team management experience and so we emphasize that this person does not need to be somebody who is already leading a topic.

We recommend that when you first sit down with your group, someone volunteers to serve as the chair for your project.
This person should be responsible for:
* Ensuring that the group works to the suggested agenda.
* The group is ready to present their work during their presentation slot. 
* The code/outputs are well organized.
This is an excellent way of getting some team management experience and so we emphasize that this person does not need to be the person listed. 

Check the [agenda]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link agenda.md %}) or the `#code-sprint-2022` channel on Slack
for more detailed information.

## How we are communicating

We are using:
* **Google Meet** for the talks and breakout groups. All participants will be invited to all the meetings so virtual attendees can easily move between them as needed. 
* **Slack** for text-based chat, sharing of ideas, announcements and technical support (we have a channel for each project group, plus the main #code-sprint-2022 channel. Join that with this [link](https://ioos.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-16fcb3lev-SsqZQkXC~Z23KbTvosUaNg#/shared-invite/email). 
* **[Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources.md %})** will be where any slides, or resources can be linked for reference during the event of afterwards (this page will live on!). 
* **[Topic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link topics.md %})** pages will fill out as the sprint progresses. Anyone can submit a change to these pages. 

## How we are storing code, data and outputs

Each project should have:

* A **GitHub repository**, which you can use to share you code and the outcomes
  of your work

<div class="lead" markdown="1">
We ask that by the end of the code sprint:

1. Your project's GitHub repository has a **README** file, identifying what work
   you did, how far you got and what the next steps required are
2. You identify one (or more) **key figures** that could be showcased at the 
   Annual DMAC meeting.
</div>

## Where to go for help

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
The best way to contact us during the code sprint is to use the #code-sprint-2022 on Slack.

## A note on bandwidth at the event

For those attending in-person, at The Pendry, we will be using the wifi network provided by the hotel. If you need high bandwidth to download large amounts of data for your project we recommend using cloud services, preload on local machine, or bring usb sticks. If you have special circumstances or questions, please post your requirements to the `#code-sprint-2022` Slack channel and we can see how we can accomodate your needs.

## Feedback

We really appreciate your feedback on this code sprint, in the hope that we can improve future events for yourself and others. Near the end of the code sprint we will send round a link to a feedback form for you to complete.
