# Welcome to the IOOS Code Sprint

**Thank you for taking part!**

This guide explains how the code sprint is being organised, from how we will be
communicating, what activities we envisage you will undertake, how we suggest
you access data and store your code/outputs.

## Professional standards

We value the input of all our participants and want everyone to have an
enjoyable experience at our code sprint. All participants and organisers are
required to agree with and follow our [code of conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link code-of-conduct.md %}),
and this will be enforced this throughout the event. We expect everyone to
behave professionally and show each other respect and courtesy to others
throughout the event. This includes social and fringe events, whether officially
part of the code sprint or not.

As this is a virtual event, we recommend that you take full advantage of the
available resources, including video calling on Zoom and text messaging via
Slack. However we recognize that not everyone is able to or comfortable in doing
this, so please don't pressure others to do so.

## How our event is structured

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
We recommend that during your first breakout group session, you **nominate a
group chair** for your project.

This person should be responsible for ensuring that the group works to the
suggested agenda, the group is ready to present their work during their
presentation slot, and that the code/outputs are well organised.

This is an excellent way of getting some team management experience and so we
emphasise that this person **need not be the project lead listed on the
abstract**.
</div>

Over the four-day code sprint, we have organised:

* A series of introductory talks to kick us off at 9:00am each morning
* Followed by 2 hours of breakout work in project groups
* A guided video yoga session before lunch each day
* Further breakout work in the afternoon, with an additional talk on the second
  day
* Short presentations from selected groups to round off each day

Check the [agenda]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link agenda.md %}) or the announcements channel on Slack
for more detailed information.

## How we are communicating

We are using:

* **Zoom** for the talks and breakout groups (we will use one Zoom call for the
  duration of the event, and you will be able to move between rooms as you need)
* **Slack** for text-based chat, sharing of ideas, announcements and technical
  support (we have a channel for each project group, plus another channel for
  support from our team of data scientists)
* **Online documents** shared documents (one per project), to record notes, ideas
  and work collaboratively

## How we are storing code, data and outputs

Each project should have:

* A **GitHub repository**, which you can use to share you code and the outcomes
  of your work

<div class="lead" markdown="1">
We ask that by the end of the code sprint:

1. Your project's GitHub repository has a **README** file, identifying what work
   you did, how far you got and what the next steps required are
2. You identify one (or more) **key figures** that could be showcased at the 
   Annual DMAC meeting.
</div>

## Where to go for help

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
The best way to contact us during the code sprint is to use the
**[#help channel](https://cmip6moap.slack.com/archives/help) on Slack**.
</div>

## Feedback

We really appreciate your feedback on this code sprint, in the hope that we can
improve future events for yourself and others. Near the end of the code sprint we
will send round a link to a feedback form for you to complete.
