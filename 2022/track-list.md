# Code Sprint tracks for 2022

This is the development page for topic ideas during the 2022 IOOS Code Sprint. Each header below identifies a track during the code sprint (essentially the room each group will be in). Within each track, various topics are identified for sprint projects.

For each topic, we recommend that the lead submits an [issue](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-code-sprint/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=code-sprint-project-proposal.md&title=Project+title) to this repository, identifying the scope of that topic. This will help ensure each code sprint topic has a plan that can be executed during the code sprint week. 

Expectations for topic leads: Leads are expected to identify a plan for the code sprint topic, establish a team, and take the lead on executing said plan.
