The IOOS Code Sprint is a 4-day hackathon style event on **25-28 April 2022**, organized by the Great Lakes Observing System (GLOS) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Office. Over the course of the event, teams of developers, academic researchers, and community members will work on projects that address pressing data and information challenges. Projects will relate to the IOOS mission to produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

Researchers will sign up to work on [topics ranging from]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) ERDDAP, General Python, Biology/Ecology, Cloud, IoT, Metadata, and more. Teams will be lead by individuals who have a keen interest in topics. Some specific topics identified include:
* Using ERDDAP in the IOOS RA/DAC archive pipelines.
