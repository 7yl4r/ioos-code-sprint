Open source biodiversity indicator development from open data.

**Expected Outcomes:**

This project aims to advance the state of biodiversity indicators generated from open data.
I intend to document efforts using jupyter notebooks.
Accessibility of Jupyter notebooks will be enhanced using mybinder.org.
My preferred language for this analysis is python but R+julia will also be available.
Visualization & statistics from data will be pursued.
Analyses will specifically focus on one of the three: 1) spatial mapping of biodiversity, 2) biodiversity time-series, 3) species-specific comparisons.

**Skills required:**

Anybody familiar with python/R/julia, OBIS/GBIF/DwC, or biodiversity indices are welcome.

**Difficulty:**

Moderate
