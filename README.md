# IOOS Code Sprint

We're pleased to announce that IOOS plans to host the 2022 DMAC Code Sprint in Chicago with our partner GLOS!

Save the dates of April 25 - 28, 2022 for the second DMAC community code sprint.  We're planning to host an in person event in Chicago, with the option for virtual participation for those who are unable to travel to be there in person. 

We'll be reaching out in the near future with more details about meeting logistics, sprint/activity planning, technologies we hope to use for the virtual component of the sprint, and all the rest.

If you have any suggestions or input about the sprint, please post them in the #dmac channel in the IOOS Slack - https://ioos.slack.com. As we did two years ago, we expect to use Slack heavily during the sprint.
